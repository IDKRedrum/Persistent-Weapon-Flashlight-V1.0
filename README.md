**Persistent Weapon Flashlight V1.0**

This fivem script makes the flashlight on your weapon stay on when you're not aiming and when you're in a vehicle. 
To toggle the flashlight you use the same controls as in the normal game, E on the keyboard and DPad Right on the controller, by default. 

This is standalone, This does not have any weapon fire rate features, Although it can be intergrated!
